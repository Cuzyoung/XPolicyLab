# Pi_05

**Contributor:** RoboDojo Team | **Paper:** Pi0.5 technical report | **arXiv:** TBD | **Original code:** https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi

`Pi_05` adapts Physical Intelligence's π0.5 policy to XPolicyLab/RoboDojo through the uv-managed OpenPI stack. Integration scripts live at this directory level; the vendored upstream implementation lives in `openpi/`.

Shared conventions — argument meanings, checkpoint naming, split-machine deployment, `EVAL_ENV_TYPE` — are documented in the [XPolicyLab README](../../README.md). Official results: [RoboDojo LeaderBoard](https://robodojo-benchmark.com/LeaderBoard).

## Installation

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Pi_05
bash install.sh
source openpi/.venv/bin/activate  # OpenPI is uv-managed; there is no policy conda env
```

`eval.sh` arg 9 is not a conda env: pass `uv` (uses `deploy.yml` `policy_uv_env_path`) or an explicit OpenPI project path.

## Data Processing

Converts RoboDojo demonstrations into the LeRobot repo consumed by training. The optional `expert_data_num` caps episodes for data conversion only (it is not part of checkpoint naming); the optional `raw_task_dirs` is a source task directory or comma-separated task list under `data/<bench_name>/` (defaults to `ckpt_name`). `raw_task_dirs` may also be passed directly as the 5th argument to write a differently named dataset from all of a task's demos, e.g. `bash process_data.sh RoboDojo stack_bowls_ablation arx_x5 joint stack_bowls`.

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Pi_05
bash process_data.sh <bench_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> [expert_data_num] [raw_task_dirs]

# Example: convert stack_bowls demos for arx_x5 joint control
bash process_data.sh RoboDojo stack_bowls arx_x5 joint

# Example: create a 50-episode ablation while reading from the original task data
bash process_data.sh RoboDojo stack_bowls_50ep arx_x5 joint 50 stack_bowls
```

## Training

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Pi_05
bash train.sh <bench_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> <gpu_id>

# Example: train a cotrain run on GPU 0 (comma-separated gpu_id for multi-GPU)
bash train.sh RoboDojo cotrain arx_x5 joint 0 0
```

Checkpoints land in `checkpoints/<bench_name>-<ckpt_name>-<env_cfg_type>-<action_type>-<seed>/`; at eval time `ckpt_name` may be the short run name (auto-combined into that directory name), the full run-directory name, or a path to a checkpoint directory. By default training reads the LeRobot repo produced by `process_data.sh` (`<bench_name>-<ckpt_name>-<env_cfg_type>-<action_type>`); override with `OPENPI_LEROBOT_REPO_ID` when reusing an existing dataset. `train.sh` sets `fsdp_devices=1` for one visible GPU and `2` for multi-GPU by default (override with `OPENPI_FSDP_DEVICES`).

## Evaluation

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Pi_05
bash eval.sh <bench_name> <task_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> \
  <policy_gpu_id> <env_gpu_id> <policy_uv_env> <eval_env_conda_env>

# Example: evaluate a trained cotrain checkpoint on stack_bowls
bash eval.sh RoboDojo stack_bowls RoboDojo-cotrain-arx_x5-joint-0 arx_x5 joint 0 0 0 uv <eval_env_conda_env>
```

`EVAL_ENV_TYPE=debug` runs the offline wiring check (no simulator); leave it unset or set `EVAL_ENV_TYPE=sim` for RoboDojo simulation. For split-machine deployment via `setup_eval_policy_server.sh` / `setup_eval_env_client.sh`, follow the [Deployment Flow](../../README.md#-deployment-flow).

## Configuration

`deploy.yml` keys to check before evaluation: `checkpoint_num`, `result_dir`, `obs_transform_pipeline`, `policy_uv_env_path`, `train_config_name` (must match the config used by `train.sh`), `repo_id`.

Set `inference_seed: 0` explicitly in deployment recipes (the adapter default is 0).
This integer in `[0, 2**32)` controls action-sampling noise independently of the
training/checkpoint naming field `seed`. Model initialization and every `reset()`
restart the noise sequence; consecutive inference calls advance it. JAX resets
its PRNG key without clearing compilation caches. PyTorch uses a separate
generator on the policy device and passes its noise through the sampler's existing
`noise` argument, leaving global RNGs unchanged. Explicitly supplied noise takes
precedence. This does not guarantee identical values across backends/devices or
deterministic device kernels. The effective seed is included in runtime metadata.
For ManiMux, preparing a new rollout sends RESET; Start/Resume and Pause/Home do
not reset this model RNG. If warmup inference is added, RESET after warmup before
the first measured request.

Environment variables used by the adapter scripts:

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `OPENPI_LEROBOT_REPO_ID` | Overrides the LeRobot repo id used by `train.sh`; defaults to `<bench_name>-<ckpt_name>-<env_cfg_type>-<action_type>`. |
| `OPENPI_FSDP_DEVICES` | Overrides the FSDP device count passed to OpenPI training. |
| `OPENPI_TRAIN_CONFIG_NAME` | Overrides the training config; defaults to `pi05_base_aloha_full_sim_arx-x5_seed_0`. |
| `OPENPI_DATA_MODE` | Data-processing mode passed to `openpi/scripts/process_data.py`; defaults to `image`. |
| `OPENPI_LOCAL_CACHE_ROOT` | Per-host local cache root for the HF datasets / JAX compilation caches; defaults to `/tmp/openpi-cache-$(hostname)`. |

`OPENPI_ROOT` and `OPENPI_SRC` are additional overrides consumed by the local scripts.

## Inference Sampling Capabilities

The adapter exposes six explicit WebSocket sampling modes:

| Mode | Adapter method | OpenPI path |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | `get_action` | unchanged official single-sample inference |
| `rtc` | `get_action_rtc` | JAX Pi-guided conditioning hook |
| `aac` | `get_action_aac` | one prefix/KV-cache pass followed by an `N`-sample denoising batch |
| `paint` | `get_action_paint` | paper Algorithm 1: naive forward, backward Euler, prefix noise repaint, final forward |
| `autohorizon` | `get_action_autohorizon` | third-step action self-attention plus the pinned official bidirectional soft-pointer |
| `dvac` | `get_action_dvac` | final-step clean-estimate variance and the paper's rolling adaptive prefix rule |

AAC accepts `{"mode": "aac", "num_samples": N}` for exactly one observation and returns `N`
native action chunks. It is JAX-only and cannot be combined with RTC conditioning. The adapter does
not calculate entropy, robot kinematics, motion thresholds or candidate selection; those remain
client/runtime responsibilities. Calls that omit AAC parameters continue through the original
single-sample callable.

PAINT accepts `{"mode": "paint", "action_prefix": A[s:s+d], "delay_steps": d}`. The adapter
normalizes the raw robot-unit prefix with the same official input transform as model actions, then
runs `3N` velocity evaluations without gradients. The public PAINT repository currently contains
documentation rather than source code, so this path is an explicit paper reproduction of
arXiv:2606.19774, not an upstream-code claim.

DVAC accepts `{"mode": "dvac", "tail_steps": 5, "alpha": 2.0,
"rolling_window_size": 5, "min_execution_steps": 1, "max_execution_steps": H}`. It reuses the
existing JAX Euler velocity evaluations, computes Equation 4 over the valid normalized action
dimensions, and keeps the rolling threshold state in the Pi05 adapter. No author repository was
located, so this path is an explicit paper reproduction of arXiv:2606.03847v1 rather than an
official-code port.

## Tianji pass-ball zero-pose deployment

This opt-in, deployment-only profile supports `env_cfg_type: tianji_dual` and `action_type: ee`.
Select `observation_profile: tianji_taccap_pi05_zero_pose`; existing ALOHA/YAM profiles are
unchanged. `model.py` constructs the dedicated `PassBallZeroPoseModel(ModelTemplate)` for
this profile, using the same shared XPolicyLab server and checkpoint/dimension helpers.

Source: Physical Intelligence OpenPI, https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi,
training revision `215abfb217dbac7d5f1273282331b9b1866c0479`. The local pass-ball reproduction
comes from the submitted source archive of run
`pi05-passball-zero-pose-h32-b16-60k-20260923-192017`; it has no separate upstream repository
URL. `pass_ball_pose.py` and `pass_ball_state.py` retain the submitted numeric transforms
and their source SHA256 comments. `pass_ball_model.py` reconstructs its inference transforms
without importing the private training project or referring to training-machine paths.
OpenPI remains in the existing vendored `openpi/` directory with its license intact.

This profile's data conversion and training entry points are **not integrated** into the
standard `process_data.sh` / `train.sh`; those existing commands still serve their original
profiles. The downloaded training archive is provenance, not a runtime dependency.

Required deployment keys: `model_state_encoding: zero_pose`,
`train_config_name: pi05_pass_ball_hifi_umi_lora_zero_pose`, `action_horizon: 32`,
`output_format: xpolicylab`, `action_semantics: absolute_per_arm_base_xyz_wxyz`,
`checkpoint_num`, `checkpoint_variant`, `checkpoint_source`, `model_path`,
`norm_stats_path`, `norm_stats_sha256`, `norm_stats_source`, `repo_id`, `num_steps`.
The model is LoRA Pi05 with 20 native dimensions padded to 32. The native order is
right/left with Rot6D first-two-row rotations and continuous normalized openings.
Model pose slots are zeroed after quantile normalization; real request TCPs remain
outside the model as the shared anchor for all 32 targets. The tool-axis change is
inverted before returning standard absolute per-arm-base `xyz + wxyz` action dictionaries.
Two wrist RGB images are active; the synthetic black base view has a false image mask.
Only default sampling is supported for this profile.

Run one hardware-free, synthetic-image forward from the parent workspace:

```bash
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false \
XPolicyLab/policy/Pi_05/openpi/.venv/bin/python \
  -m XPolicyLab.policy.Pi_05.offline_pass_ball \
  --config <absolute-zero-pose-recipe.yaml> --checkpoint <export>/checkpoints/20000
```

The export directory name, step and
normalization SHA256 must match the selected recipe. See
`docs/pi05-tianji-taccap-runbook.md` in the parent ManiMux workspace for paired recipes,
station binding, artifact checking and full service commands.

## Tianji pack-plate wrist-only checkpoint

This is a separate deployment profile, `tianji_taccap_pi05_pack_plate`, selected only
by the pack-plate recipe. It uses the verified `checkpoint-59999` export under
`pi05-pack-plate-wrist-only-final-59999` and its own
`assets/pack-plate-taccap-h32-zero-pose/norm_stats.json`. The LeRobot task string
is `plate`. Two wrist RGB images are active; the synthetic base image is masked.
The 20-D native order, zero-pose state, current-TCP-relative 32-step actions and
absolute normalized grippers use the Tianji transform helpers above. The local
`train_config_name` is a deployment reconstruction; the export does not contain
the submitted training configuration. Data conversion and training entry points
for this specific checkpoint are not included.

This pack-plate profile supports default and RTC sampling. The RTC condition
arrives as left/right absolute TCP poses and normalized openings from ManiMux;
it is converted to the model's right/left 20-D absolute layout, then the
existing input transform makes every conditioned pose relative to the current
observation before normalization and Pi-guided JAX sampling. Zero-weight rows
use the observation anchor as a valid pose. The pass-ball profile remains
default-only; PAINT is not advertised for pack-plate.

Static artifact inspection uses `manimux.servers.pi05 --check` with the paired
experiment and an isolated station. A synthetic GPU forward, when the GPU is idle:

```bash
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false \
XPolicyLab/policy/Pi_05/openpi/.venv/bin/python \
  -m XPolicyLab.policy.Pi_05.offline_pack_plate \
  --config manimux/configs/policy/pi05/tianji/pack_plate/wrist-only-step59999.yaml \
  --checkpoint <export>/checkpoint-59999
```

The exported README does not specify the training-time TCP axis conversion.
The deployment currently shares the tool-axis transform used for the pass-ball
Tianji data. Confirm it against the pack-plate training source before physical
execution. See `docs/pi05-tianji-pack-plate-runbook.md` in the parent workspace.
